  	<h1>Thank you for visting our page!</h1>
  	<p>I created this website so family and friends that are located all over the country can watch Paisley grow up with us.
  		This is only the first version of the site, so we promise more will come. The site is currently being hosted for free,
  		but as we get more and more views, we will need more resources which will cost significant amounts of money. So we ask,
  		only if you can and would like, to please donate to the site so we can continue to keep it running and make it grow. Thank you
  		in advance for any contributions you give.</p><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
